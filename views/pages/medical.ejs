            <p>We’ve worked closely with Dr. Brittany Lauman at Brooklyn Yard Veterinary Hospital over the last year with Phoebe. The team at Brooklyn Yard is wonderful and super committed to Phoebe’s success.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Shortly after we adopted Phoebe, she started having severe diarrhea regularly. We put her on several bland diets (rice and various meats) before determining that she is intolerant of meat products. She has done well on a hydrolyzed protein diet with only plant-based treats. She can tolerate a limited amount of dairy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over the last year, we’ve monitored some postural concerns. We noticed that Phoebe’s front legs knuckle, and she sometimes shows a slight preference for her back left leg over her right and limps slightly. Phoebe was evaluated by Dr. Roberto Novo at BluePearl Pet Hospital and he suggested that we continue to monitor the situation. Some of Phoebe’s behaviors (noise sensitivity, growling when moved, jumpy greetings) have indicated the possibility that she could be experiencing some underlying, undiagnosed pain. Recent x-rays came back normal, but we still wonder if there could be a neurological or orthopedic issue contributing to some of Phoebe’s challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We have also received significant support from Brooklyn Yard as we navigate Phoebe's generalized and separation anxiety. We've discussed the possibility that her increased anxiety is also potentially pain related. Phoebe's current med regimen aims to target both anxiety and pain, and any crossover between the two. We initially trialed clomipramine, a medication specifically used for separation anxiety, however Phoebe experienced digestive issues with that so we discontinued it. Since then, she's started Fluoxetine as an alternative.</p>
